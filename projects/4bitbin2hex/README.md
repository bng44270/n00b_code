So as a caveat, I have updated these files as this has particular nostalgia for me.  This was originally written to be an Applet, but since Applets are depricated and I wanted to make it work I have updated it accordingly.  All of the nasty coding and design flaws have been retained :)  
  
To build run ```javac FourBitBinToHex.java```
