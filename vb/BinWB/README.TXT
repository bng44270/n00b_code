Ace E's Binary Workbench

This is quite possibly the most awesome piece of software I have written for the Windows platform.  It is, in most respects, an educational tool.  It allows you to manipulate ten different 8-bit values with boolean (logical) operation, like AND, OR, XOR, and NOT.  

After starting the program, you will notice the buttons at the top of the window labeled "Sel" and "Exit".  If you don't know what the Exit button does, you shouldn't have this software right now.  The Sel button allows you to select a register to manipulate.  If you adjust the scroll bar below the buttons, you will see the register number change.  To select a register, simply move the scroll bar to the propper position and click the Sel button.  When the program begins, register R0 is automatically selected.

The lower half of the screen is devoted to the manipulation controls.  To change the value of a register that you have selected:
	1. Click the Input Button
	2. In the frame below, input the desired decimal value
	3. Click the Set button
Thats it!!  You will notice that as you type in your decimal value, the hexidecimal value is displayed beside the input box.  This is vital, unless you can do decimal-to-hex conversions in your head, because this is the way the registers store data (in hex).  

All of the logical operators are self explanitory.  Just select the register to manipulate, select operation, type in arguement (except with the NOT operation), and click Go.

I hope this program brings you assistance in your quest of knowledge.
